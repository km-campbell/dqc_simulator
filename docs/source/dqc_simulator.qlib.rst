dqc\_simulator.qlib 
===================

The quantum library. An extensible library of various predefined quantum 
objects, such as specific quantum states and quantum circuits. 

Nothing in qlib is integral to the functioning of dqc\_simulator
but qlib does increase the convenience of working with commonly 
used circuits, identities, gates and states.
