Getting started
===============

Welcome to the getting started guide for absolute beginners to using
dqc_simulator! This guide assumes that you have already installed 
dqc_simulator and its prerequisites on your system. If this is not 
the case, please follow the 
:doc:`installation instructions <installation>`. This guide also assumes  
a working knowledge of quantum computing and quantum information. 
If this is not the case, I recommend Nielsen and Chuang's excellent
introductory text [1]_.

dqc_simulator is a python package for the simple simulation of 
distributed quantum computers (DQCs). It is built on top of the
`NetSquid <https://netsquid.org/>`_ library but does not require 
a detailed understanding of NetSquid to use. That said, users that 
are more familiar with NetSquid can easily integrate the package 
into their existing workflow if they wish to consider more complicated
scenarios, such as error detection, or specify their own hardware in 
more detail.
